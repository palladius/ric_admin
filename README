RicAdmin
========

This is my first plugin for Rails 3.
I developed this by following the yaffle example here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/plugins.html
I'd like to have an admin interface to models, with some magic:
- Auto graph of models and their relationships.
- view of all models with warnings for invalid models
- Management of Rbates nifty users, if any is present

Example
=======

Example goes here.

You should go to /ric_admin/ , provided you're an admin user (you should define "current_user.admin?" )
